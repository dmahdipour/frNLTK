#frNLTK
Persian Natural Language Tool Kit 

It's first time that I want to upload it in Git.
My frNLTK is so uncompleted but I'm going to complete it by the time.
Tokenizer and Normalizer are most important part to be complete in future.

I appreciate it who want to join me to debug and complete it.
I will be glad to hear If any changes are needed.

With Regard
